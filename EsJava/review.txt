5.  Are the results in this paper easily reproducible ? *   (visible to other reviewers)
CONVINCING : I am convinced that the obtained results can be reproduced, possibly with some effort. Key resources (e.g., proofs, code, data) are already available, will be made available upon acceptance, or good reasons as to why they are not (e.g., proprietary data or code) are reported in the paper. Key details (e.g., proofs, experimental setup) are sufficiently well described but their exact recovery may require some work.
CREDIBLE: I believe that the obtained results can, in principle, be reproduced. Even though key resources (e.g., proofs, code, data) are unavailable at this point, the key details (e.g., proof sketches, experimental setup) are sufficiently well described for an expert to confidently reproduce the main results, if given access to the missing resources.
IRREPRODUCIBLE: It is not possible to reproduce the results from the description given in the paper. Some key details (e.g., proof sketches, experimental setup) are incomplete/unclear, or some key resources (e.g., proofs, code, data) are not furnished.
